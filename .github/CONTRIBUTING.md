# Contributing
Firstly, big thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️

# 1. Understand the existing code

- **Have a clear reason**: Don’t change the way things are done without a valid reason. If you propose an alteration, be prepared to explain why it’s necessary and how it improves the project.
- **Respect existing conventions**: Changes should align with the existing code style, design patterns, and overall project philosophy. If you want to introduce a new way of doing things, justify it clearly.

# 2. Write Clean, Descriptive Commit Messages

- **Be descriptive**: Your commit messages should clearly describe what the change does and why it was made.
- **Keep commits clean**: Avoid committing a change and then immediately following it with a fix for that change. Instead, amend your commit or squash it if needed.

# 3. Keep Your Pull Requests (PRs) Small and Focused

- **Make small, targeted PRs**: Focus on one feature or fix per pull request. This makes it easier to review and increases the likelihood of acceptance.
- **Avoid combining unrelated changes**: PRs that tackle multiple unrelated issues are harder to review and might be rejected because of a single problem.

# 4. Understand and Test the Code You Write

- **Review your code**: Before submitting your changes, take the time to review your code for readability, efficiency and performance. Consider how your changes affect the project.
- **Avoid using LLMs**: Don't submit AI-generated code without reviewing and testing it first. Ensure that any code you submit is thoroughly understood and meets the project's standards.
- **Testing Requirements**: Failure to conduct testing after multiple requests may result in the closure of your Pull Request.

# 5. Code Review and Feedback

- **Expect feedback**: PRs will undergo code review. Be open to feedback and willing to make adjustments as needed.
- **Participate in reviews**: If you feel comfortable, review other contributors' PRs as well. Peer review is a great way to learn and ensure high-quality contributions.

# 6. Contributing Is More Than Just Code

- **Test the tool**: Running tests and providing feedback on how the tool works in different environments is a valuable contribution.
- **Write well-formed issues**: Clearly describe bugs or problems you encounter, providing as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue.
- **Propose reasonable feature requests**: When suggesting new features, ensure they fit within the scope, style, and design of the project. Provide clear reasoning and use cases.

# 7. License

- **Agree to the license**: By contributing to Hubit, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's GPL-3 license.
